////////////Cartoon Water//////////////

////////////Troubleshoot///////////////

1. The water isn't animated?
- Try to re add the .anim file to the water plane.

2. The wafes are to big or to small?
- Adjust that by changing the tiling in the water material.

3. I have a other question?
- Contact me at contact@stefanmensen.nl
